TCMPortMapper.framework uses [libnatpmp and miniupnpc](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) to provide an easy to use Cocoa interface to automatically map ports to your networked application via UPNP and NAT-PMP.

Included is a sample application to map ports and a short illustration (an echo server) of using the framework within your own code.

This shows the BasicUsage .
